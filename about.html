<h1>Who am I?</h1>
<p>I'm just your run of the mill aspiring full stack software engineer, but with a few exceptions. When I'm not reading up on the latest and greatest technologies, you can often find me powerlifting, knitting, attempting creative writing, or binge watching the latest Netflix Original.</p>
<br>
<h3>Credentials</h3>
<p>I received my B.A. in Computer Science from the Univerisity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, but my education did not stop there. I frequently participate in CodeWars, learn new skills using Udemy (the latest being TypeScript), and network at several tech-centric meetups all around the D.C. metro area.</p>

<h3>Previous Doings</h3>
<p>TBD</p>
